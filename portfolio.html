<p>(Nylon Magazine Layout)For this piece I designed a layout for a Ryan
Reynolds article, but I gave it the same
look as you would find in a Nylon Magazine
spread. Their magazine spreads and layouts
are much more different than a Rolling
Stone magazine layout, which was interesting
because I was able to play with shapes,
large fonts and different ways to layout
photographs.
For the colour scheme, I stayed with the
warm tones in the first photo of Ryan, on the
front two pages, and I used a sans-serif font
to keep it simple and modern, like the Nylon
Magazine style. Even though it is simple and
modern, it still has its large and bold aspects
on each page.</p>
<img src="img/infographic.jpg" alt="Infographic about sugar" class="portfolio-img" />
<p>(Sugar Infographic)
For this piece I used many facts, stats and
information about sugar. The subject itself
interested me because we don’t know how
harmful it is to eat too much sugar, which
is important to know in today’s society. I
thought it would be interesting to use the
information and lay it out in a bold shape
(like a can of coke). The red was used to suit
the colour of the can, it is also very bright
and demands attention. The font I used was
more decorative and resembles marker or
scribbling, which went well with the look of
the piece because it’s so crazy and loaded
with words. Both fit well together because
they are equally as bold.</p>
<img src="img/joy-cooking.jpg" alt="Joy of Cooking quote booklet" class="portfolio-img" />
<p>(Joy of Cooking)
The full preview of this piece is attached
separately because it was too large to fit
onto one page.
For this piece, I designed a quote book
about the joys of cooking. Cooking is my
second greatest passion, and I created a
booklet of several quotes by famous chefs
and cooks that I thought were interesting
and inspirational. The second aspect of
my book was that I took photos of food to
create the focused words of each page. The
colours I used complimented the food on
each page, the overall look of the booklet is
very colourful because that’s what cooking
really looks like. Each quote focuses on a
different topic, which is shown with a photo
as well.</p>
